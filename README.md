## Project Showcase

### Idea
The idea for this project came after I got a bike and wanted to some tours with nice views. I had discovered the service [komoot](https://komoot.com) where users have uploaded routes with attached pictures and statistics. I really liked the idea of using routes that other users have taken, reviewed and maybe even warned about dangerous spots. 
When I wanted to plan some holidays, which I rarely do, I noticed a lack of a similar service for travels. Travel routes with different cities or countries to visit and things to see. No long research needed, just find a good tour or combine several of them to fit your needs and budget and just worry about finding local hotels in the cities.

### Database
For the database [Supabase](https://supabase.com) was used as it provides a generous free tier for a PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication, storage and serverless functions. It is also open-source and self-hostable and I want to use products that offer me that flexibility.
The auth integration also sets up email-verification, email-password-reset and magic-links. One can also set up OAuth with providers such as Google, Github, Facebook and much more.
